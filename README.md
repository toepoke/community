# [toepoke](https://toepoke.co.uk) community website

Following the decision of [User Voice](https://uservoice.com) to sunset their free plan we've had to move the suggestions and <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> somewhere else. [Github](https://github.com) seems a natural choice as that's where the source code for toepoke lives (not in this repository I must add).

## FAQ

The FAQ now lives in the [wiki](https://github.com/toepoke/community/wiki).

## Suggestions

Improvements and feedback have always been welcome and this isn't changing.

Please raise your suggestion as an [issue](https://github.com/toepoke/community/issues), with the _label_ **suggestion**

## Bugs

Bugs can also be raised as an [issue](https://github.com/toepoke/community/issues), with a _label_ of **bug**.

If you prefer you can raise a bug by [contacting us](https://toepoke.co.uk/about.aspx/contact) instead.  Indeed this is recommended if you need to share personal data in order to resolve the issue.
